# Options for the user to select:
# 1 - Make Combo [ Visa ]
# 2 - Check Visa

# If the user selects option 1:
# - It generates random visa-like numbers and saves them to a file named 'Densor.txt'.

# If the user selects option 2:
# - It reads a list of visa numbers from a file and checks their validity using the 'HamodyTools' module.

# Input for option 1:
# - 16-digit visa numbers
# - 2-digit expiration month and year
# - 3-digit CVC code

# The program writes generated visa data into 'Densor.txt'.

# Input for option 2:
# - User provides a file containing visa numbers to check.

# The output for option 2:
# - Valid visa numbers are saved in 'visa_true.txt'.
# - Invalid visa numbers are labeled as "Dead Visa".

# The user gets an error message for invalid input if neither option 1 nor 2 is selected.
